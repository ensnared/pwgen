    - Set list of consonants used in password creation.
    - Default is all consonants in the english alphabet.
- `Password::setDigits()`
    - Set number of digits to add to end of password.
    - Default is 2.
- `Password::setDoubleConsonantsAfterVowel()`
    - Set the list of double consonants that will only be used after a vowel in a password.
- `Password::setDoubleConsonantsAnywhere()`
    - Set the list of double consonants that can be used anywhere in a password.
- `Password::setDoubleConsonantsFirst()`
    - Set the list of double consonants that will only be used in the beginning of a password.
- `Password::setDoubleVowelsAfterConsonant()`
    - Set the list of double vowels that will only be used after a consonant in a password.

- `Password::setDoubleVowelsFirst()`
    - Set the list of double vowels that will only be used in the beginning of a password.
- `Password::setMaxLength()`
    - Set the maximum length of generated passwords.
